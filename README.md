# Drake Spotify Analysis

## Context
In 2023, Drake ended up being my #1 artist on Spotify. Out of curiosity, I decided to investigate the Gen-Z popularized classification of Drake's recent lyrics as "zesty" (which in this context, refers to the distinctive and energetic qualities that make certain songs in his discography stray from the typical tough-guy deliveries generally present in rap).

## Goal
This data analysis project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the supposed "zestiness" present in some of Drake's songs. I used the Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn libraries in combination with Spotify's Web API to extract audio features and create graphical visuals in order to draw my conclusions.

**Note:** If attempting to replicate the project on your own, reference your own unique Spotify API Client ID/Secret. See [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started) for instructions on how.
